Module 1, 2:
------------
1.Beginner level:
-----------------
1. Hands-on power bi desktop application
2. this model will explore identifying and retriving data from various data sources.
3. connectivity and data storage
4 understanding the difference and performance implication of connecting directly to data versus importing it during this module.

1.sample supler store: Excel file
power Bi Desktop
In Excel file has 3 tables: load 3 tables orders, returns, users
save and close

2.open northwind access file open 
customers
employees
order details
prodects
shipers
supplies
load and save northwind
Table Relationship:
file -> options and settings -> options -> Current file -> data load -> relatinship -> check 3 check boxes ok
save then close

3. load from website
goto list of U.S. states and territories by income - wikipedia website.
get data -> box open -> other -> web
from web -> paste web address -> ok
select table -> load

4. Customer data excel file
pivot table, pivot chart are there.
power pivotdata model used to capture it.
if we don't hava pivot table we can do it.
we have to import data from power bi.
file -> import -> powerquery, power pivot. power report.
select customer tables -> start 

5.Resolving Data Errors(load error)
1. remove excel source file in sample super store folder. open sample super store power bi it will open. go to data tab the tables are displayed but, click refresh button on home tab it shows errors.
2. file -> options and settings -> data source settings
	-> change source file -> open the path select sorce directory -> close - Apply changes.
	
5. No power view how to use report:
1.file -> import -> power query, power view and, power report
  select -> IT spend Analysis Sample excel file. -> start.
  there are 9 queries,9 data model table and 15 KPIs and measures as well as 3 power view sheets.close it
  2. is shows error power bi didnot support the file error.
  click the error frame delete and make it one supported
  
 6. open file from one drive
 	open -> other -> web -> paste the path load

7. create visualization 
--------------------
open static barchart (or) drag and drop.
fileds -> orders table -> city, sales (drag and drop) 
filter -> kearens  8 sales are in the city
save sample super store od.xlsh (onedrive).
publish -> go to change the excel file
come to desktop refresh and save



Module-3:
--------
2. Intermediate level
----------------------
1. clean, transform, and load data into the data model.
2. profiling and understanding the condition of data
3. how to identify anomalies, look at the size and shape of the data and perform data cleaning and transforming.
4. preparing data loading into the model.
sample super store.xlsh -> excel file open it
1.Data shaping or transforming the data by renaming columns or tables, removing rows, setting the first row as headers:
1. data transformation steps in users table and orders table
view -> data view
1. rename table users into Managers table
-----------------------------------------
right click -> users -> rename manager.
2. promote first row as column heading
home -> queries ->transform data -> open new query editor
manager
home -> transform -> use first row as headers
manager field click dot make copy manager.
rename manager into manager first
rename copy manager into manager last
right click replace value last names
evens
rogers
smith
willioms
2.change the orders table
--------------------------
home -> choose column uncheck the check box
row id, order priority, product base margin, quantity ordered new -> ok
1. filter the state or province 
click the dot button in state or province -> auto filter
wait for whole data load. unckeck all -> select
Arizona, california, new jercy, new yark, florida -> ok

2.rename state or province into state -> click dot -> click sort asscending -> close and apply -> apply changes

3. enhancing the data model:
---------------------------
1. merge information from managers table into orders table
region column is same in both manager and order tables
2. goto -> home -> queries -> transform data -> in power query
home -> combine -> merge queries -> merge query as new
orders -> click region -> bottom select -> managers -> click region
Right Outer : All from second table, matching from first
join kind select from drop down Right Outer -> ok
Join types:
-----------
Default Join is Left Outer: All from first table, matching from second
Right Outer : All from second table, matching from first
Full Outer : All rows from both tables
Inner : Only matching rows
Left Anti : Rows only in first table
Right Anti : Rows only in second  table

After ok New merge1 is open. in the merge1 last column is managers -> click the dot check three columns region, first, last manager -> ok
central region is null in left side -> click dot -> click load more in manager region uncheck central -> ok
again manager click dot -> ascending order
right side Properties pane change name Merge1 into Orders by region.
-> close and apply 
same way Merge and create returned Orders.
3.Profiling Data:
----------------
home -> queries -> transform data
view -> Data Preview -> check Calumn Quality, check column distribution, and column profile -> close

Module -4 
1. Fundamental concepts of designing and developing a data model for proper performance and scalibility.
2. Data modelling issues, including relationships, security and performance.
3. continue with sample super store.
Orders Table -> Discount column to be formatted as a percentage
	     -> Unit Price, shipping column to be formatted as currency
click one record in Discount column -> in the top column tools
formatting tab -> select % if you don't want decimal place change to 0.
select one record in unit price column - > column tools tab -> select $
select one record in shipping column - > column tools tab -> select $
right side fields -> orders select Order Date -> column tools tab -> format select March14, 2001 from dropdown
right side fields -> orders select Ship Date -> column tools tab -> format select March14, 2001 from dropdown
select 1 record from state -> column tools >categorical tab -> data category -> state or Province -> next city -> postal code -> glob icon shows
Fact - Dimonsion table:
------------------------
Fact :  Keeps numeric data that might be aggregated in the reporting visualizations.
E.g., Sales, Profits
Dimension: Keeps descriptive information that can slice and dice the data in the fact table. Require a key field.
E.g., Customer Info, Product Info
should not have fact and descriptive field in the same table.
right click orders table -> copy it then -> right click paste in queries pan -> open it  select Discount column -> manage columns - choose coloums -> uncheck all columns-> then check
customer id, customer name, customer segment, region, state, city, postal code, region, customer segment, discount.
change name DimCustomer from field right.
----------------------------------------
put customer id first, customer name, city, state, postal code, region.

same as another copy of orders table then select product category, Products-sub category, Product containors, Product Name
change name DimProducts
-----------------------
put Product name first, create new column for numeric
add column -> index column -> custom -> 001 increment 1 ->
drop index column is the first column now, product name, category, sub-category, containers  --> close and apply
Index -> right click -> Rename -> product ID
create Hierarchy:
-----------------
In Orders table -> select Region -> rightclick -> create Hierarchy
select state -> right click -> add hierarchy -> region hierarchy
select City -> right click -> add hierarchy -> region hierarchy
select postal code -> right click -> add hierarchy -> region hierarchy

file -> options and settings -> options -> Current file -> data load -> relatinship -> check 3 check boxes ok
save then close

Model View:
-----------
In Model view -> in the table click eye it will hide.
DimCustomers - hide, Returned Orders - hide
DimProducts - hide, orders by region - hide

Orders and returns -> create relationship -> OrderID (one to many)
click Manage relationship -> Autudetect relationship -> ok

Row level security:
-------------------
Model -> Security -> Manage roles
click create -> roles type East -> Tables select Orders
DAX(Data Analysis Expression) - It's a Formula Language 
[region]="East"            Save
Model -> Security -> Manage roles
click create -> roles type West -> Tables select Orders
DAX(Data Analysis Expression) - It's a Formula Language 
[region]="West"            Save
Model -> Security -> View as --> we can see East and West we created.
Publish



Advance Level Project3:
-----------------------
DAX, Aggrication, Quick Measures, Measures, Calculated tables and Calculated columns to solve calculation and data analysis problems.
DAX - stands for Data Analysis expressions and it is the formula 			
      language used in PowerBI.
      DAX is a collection of functions, operators and constants 
      that can be used in formula or expression to calculate and 
      return one or more values.
Modules:
--------
Sample super store and retail sales analysis

Distinct function in DAX:
-------------------------
 To create a caoculated table that will return one column of all of the distinct order IDs from the orders table.
create calculated column:
-------------------------
Distinct Function -> create Distinct Order Id
Distinct order Count:
----------------------
Modelling -> calculation -> New table 
In Formula Bar write function -> Distinct Order Count = DISTINCT(Orders[Order ID])
Difference between Order Date and Ship Date:
--------------------------------------------
Right click Order -> create new column -> Days to Ship = DATEDIFF(orders[Order Date].[Date], Orders[Ship Date].Date, DAY) 
Sales Ranking Highest(Not Using this):
--------------------------------------
Create new column in Orders -> Sales Ranking Highest = RANKX(Orders, Orders[Sales])-> Highest ranking sales start with low value(No.1), Lowest ranking sales value start with higher No.
Edit above High to low
Sales Ranking Lowest(Not Using this):
--------------------------------------
Edit Sales Ranking Highest -> Sales Ranking Lowest = RANKX(Orders, Orders[Sales],,ASC) -> Highest ranking sales start with High value, Lowest ranking sales start with low value(No.1).
open excel sample super store -> W369 change the value 52.97
Refresh in power BI
In Orders Table -> Click Order ID Dot-> type 8853 Order Id -> Uncheck All -> check 88538, 88539 -> ok. two rows shows -> click the dot clear filter.
Click Sales Ranking Lowest Dot -> type 547 there is nothing type 548 ->
it shows number 548 -> now cancel the filter.
Sales Ranking Lowest No Skip(Not Using this):
----------------------------------------------
Edit Sales Ranking Lowest -> Sales Ranking Lowest No Skip = RANKX(Orders, Orders[Sales],,ASC,Dense) -> Highest ranking sales start with High value, Lowest ranking sales start with low value(No.1). It's not skip value
Measures:
---------
File size is an issue we may use measures instead of using calculated table and calculated column.
Two variations of measures:
---------------------------
Qucik measures : Templates of source
Measures : Build from scratch
Quick Measures:
---------------
Right Click Orders Table -> Create Quick Measures -> Dialog box open -> 

In Calculation dropdown select -> Total for category(filters not applied)

In Fields Pan Select -> Orders -> goto Sales   -> Drag and Drop into the Base Value in Calculation side -> it shows Sum of sales We need Average So Click ... (eclipse) or more option -> select Average of sales.

In Fields Pan Select -> Orders -> goto Customer Segment -> Drag and Drop into the Category in Calculation side. ok
Now we can see the formula automatically created.
Average of Sales total for Customer Segment = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Orders'[Sales]), ALL('Orders'[Customer Segment]))
1.Create report form view:
---------------------------
* In Report view -> Drag Average of Sales total for Customer Segment Measure From Fields Pan Orders table and drop into report view. 
* Drag Customer Segment Drop into Axis box from Visualizations Pan.
*Drag Product Category Drop into small multiple box from Visualizations Pan.
Delete it Save this.
Measures: Measures from scratch:
--------------------------------
* Right Click Orders -> create Measures 
* Formula Bar -> Average Sales per Product Category = CALCULATE(AVERAGE(Orders[Sales]),ALLSELECTED(Orders[Product Category]))           
Time Intelligence Function:
----------------------------
* Calender *Calender Auto
Calender Auto
-------------
* Select Orders Table in Fields Pan -> Table tools -> new table -> Dates = ADDCOLUMNS(CALENDERAUTO(),"Year",YEAR([Date]),
"Quarter","Q"&QUARTER([Date]),
"Month",FORMAT([Date],"mmmm"),
"Month Number",MONTH([Date])
)

Mark as Date:
---------------
* Click Dates -> Right click Date Table -> Mark as Date Table -> Mark as Date tanle -> dialog will open Date column Dropdown select Date ok.

Create relationship between orsers and date table:
--------------------------------------------------
* In Model view -> Drag Order Date from Orders table Drop into Date field into the Dates table. In * In Table view days to skip shows error change it:
---------------------------------------------------
Right click Order -> create new column -> Days to Ship = DATEDIFF(orders[Order Date], Orders[Ship Date], DAY) 
create new column:
------------------
* Right Click Orders table -> create new column
End of Months = ENDOFMONTH(Orders[Order Date])
* Right Click Orders table -> create new column
End of Quarter = ENDOFQUARTER(Orders[Order Date])
*Select End of Month Column -> Column tools -> Format March 14, 2001(mmmm d yyyy) select it.
*Select End of Quarter Column -> Column tools -> Format March 14, 2001(mmmm d yyyy) select it.
