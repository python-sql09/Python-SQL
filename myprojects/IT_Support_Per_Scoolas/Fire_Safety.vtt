Hello everyone, it's time to talk safety.
Let's go over some guidelines in order to avoid
cuts, burns, electrical shock and damage to your eyesight.
To start off we want to remove any watches or jewelry and also secure our loose clothing, done.
We also need to make sure that we turn off and unplug any equipment before we work on it.
A safe and usable work station is going to be a clean work station, so make sure you keep food and drinks and any clutter out of our workspace.
We also need to make sure that as we work inside of a computer case, that any sharp objects
should be covered with tape.
For your own safety, you should never open a power supply or a monitor that has a built-in power supply.
And while we work it's very important to wear safety goggles to prevent damage to your eyesight.
When you go to lift those heavy computer towers, printers, servers and more, make sure that you bend your knees when you lift heavy objects to avoid injuring your back.
As we work with electrical and dangerous components, you never know when something might catch fire.
You should always know where the closest fire extinguisher is and also how to use it.
As we discuss fire safety, it's important that you remember to never fight a fire that is out of control or not contained.
You should make sure you know how to get out of the building quickly that you are in.
And don't forget to contact emergency services for help.
Make sure you're prepared.
You should locate and read instructions on any fire extinguisher near your workspace 
before you use them.
Also you should make sure that the fire extinguisher is going to work.
For example, this fire extinguisher no longer is ready to work, it needs a recharge.

You should know the basics of using a fire extinguisher to prevent a small fire from getting out of control.
The word you have to remember is pass.
P stands for pull the pin.
