1. Review Financial Information
Download and review the latest annual report from Reynolds American or its parent company BAT (British American Tobacco).

Find this on BATâ€™s investor relations site: https://www.bat.com

Look at key sections like:

Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow

Capital structure (debt vs. equity)

Inventory and supply chain data

Marketing expenses and ROI

Operating unit performance

2. Identify One Area for Improvement
Pick one focus area that you think could be improved. Examples:

Finance: Capital structure, cost management, profitability

Supply Chain: Inventory turnover, cost of goods sold

Marketing: Ad spend vs. revenue, market share trends

Sustainability / ESG: Investment in reduced-risk products

Product Portfolio: Sales performance by product type (vape, smokeless, traditional)

ðŸ‘‰ Use benchmarks from competitors (e.g., Altria, Philip Morris) to justify your ideas if helpful.
