📊 Slide 2: Executive Summary
Title:
🔹 Optimizing Capital Structure to Strengthen Financial Flexibility

Insight:
BAT has high levels of debt (£36.95B in 2024) and incurred significant finance costs (£1.6B adjusted). While it maintains strong cash flow, this capital structure limits agility and increases exposure to macroeconomic volatility.

Recommendation:
Suspend or reduce share buyback program (£1.6B planned) and redirect funds toward debt reduction to:

Lower interest burden and enhance profitability

Improve credit ratings and investor confidence

Provide room for strategic investments (e.g., Smokeless Products, R&D)

Expected Impact:

Potential savings of ~£1.6B

Improved leverage ratio (already improved to 2.4x in 2024)

More resilient long-term capital structure and higher retained earnings

📈 Slide 3: Debt Trend (2022–2024)
Year	Total Borrowings	YoY Change
2022	£43.1B	—
2023	£39.7B	-7.9%
2024	£36.95B	-7.0%

Leverage Ratio improved from 2.9x → 2.4x

Significant progress, but £1.6B still spent on buybacks in 2024

Finance cost in 2024: £1.6B adjusted — ~6% of total revenue

📊 Slide 4: Peer Comparison — Capital Structure
Company	Debt/EBITDA	Interest Expense (B)	Share Buyback?
BAT	2.4x	£1.6B (adj)	Yes (£1.6B)
Altria	~2.1x	$1.0B	Yes (reduced)
Philip Morris	~2.0x	$0.9B	Limited

Competitors maintaining lower leverage

BAT's higher buybacks during high-rate environment = riskier capital decision

💸 Slide 5: Alternative Scenario – Dividend + Debt Strategy
Current Strategy:
Dividend payout: £5.9B (240.24p/share)

Share buyback: £1.6B (2024–25)

Total shareholder returns: ~£7.5B

Alternative:
Maintain dividend

Suspend buyback

Use £1.6B for early debt repayment → save interest and reduce risk

✅ Even a 1% reduction in financing cost (~£370M/year) compounds to long-term savings

🟢 More flexibility to invest in:

Smokeless innovation (17.5% of revenue)

Expansion into Asia-Pacific/Oral category
