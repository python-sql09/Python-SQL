Import the CSV file into Power BI.
2. Data Cleaning
Convert AvgTalkDuration to seconds for calculation.
Replace empty fields with NULL values.
3. Create Measures
Total Calls Answered:
DAX
Copy
Edit
TotalAnswered = COUNTROWS(FILTER(CallData, CallData[Answered] = "Y"))
Total Calls Abandoned:
DAX
Copy
Edit
TotalAbandoned = COUNTROWS(FILTER(CallData, CallData[Answered] = "N"))
Average Speed of Answer:
DAX
Copy
Edit
AvgSpeedOfAnswer = AVERAGE(CallData[Speed of answer in seconds])
Resolution Rate:
DAX
Copy
Edit
ResolutionRate = DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER(CallData, CallData[Resolved] = "Y")), COUNTROWS(CallData))
Average Satisfaction:
DAX
Copy
Edit
AvgSatisfaction = AVERAGE(CallData[Satisfaction rating])
Average Handle Time:
DAX
Copy
Edit
AvgHandleTime = AVERAGE(CallData[AvgTalkDuration])
4. Visualizations
