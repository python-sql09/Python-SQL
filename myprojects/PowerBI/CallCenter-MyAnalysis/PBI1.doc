Let's break this down step-by-step to create a Power BI dashboard for Claire:

? Step 1: Load Data into Power BI
Open Power BI.
Go to Home ? Get Data ? Excel/CSV (or copy-paste the table directly).
Load the data into Power BI.
Name the table Fact_Calls.
? Step 2: Clean and Format the Data
Date and Time Formatting:
Split the Date and Time columns into Date_Id and Time_Id.
Create Date_Id and Time_Id columns using the following formulas:
?? Date_Id (in Power Query):

M
Copy
Edit
Date_Id = FORMAT(Fact_Calls[Date], "yyyyMMdd")
?? Time_Id (in Power Query):

M
Copy
Edit
Time_Id = HOUR(Fact_Calls[Time]) * 10000 + MINUTE(Fact_Calls[Time]) * 100 + SECOND(Fact_Calls[Time])
Create New Columns
Create Resolved and Answered as binary (0 = No, 1 = Yes) for easier calculations:
?? Answered Binary:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Answered_Binary = IF(Fact_Calls[Answered (Y/N)] = "Y", 1, 0)
?? Resolved Binary:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Resolved_Binary = IF(Fact_Calls[Resolved] = "Y", 1, 0)
Convert Duration to Seconds
Convert AvgTalkDuration to total seconds for calculations:
?? AvgTalkDuration (Seconds):

DAX
Copy
Edit
AvgTalkDuration_Seconds = HOUR(Fact_Calls[AvgTalkDuration]) * 3600 + MINUTE(Fact_Calls[AvgTalkDuration]) * 60 + SECOND(Fact_Calls[AvgTalkDuration])
? Step 3: Create Date and Time Dimension Tables
Create Date_dim and Time_dim in Power Query using the M code provided earlier.
Establish relationships:
Fact_Calls[Date_Id] ? Date_dim[Date_Id]
Fact_Calls[Time_Id] ? Time_dim[Time_Id]
? Step 4: Create KPIs and Measures
?? 1. Overall Customer Satisfaction
?? Measure:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Overall_Satisfaction = AVERAGE(Fact_Calls[Satisfaction rating])
?? 2. Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned
?? Measure for Total Calls:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Total_Calls = COUNTROWS(Fact_Calls)
?? Measure for Answered Calls:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Answered_Calls = SUM(Fact_Calls[Answered_Binary])
?? Measure for Abandoned Calls:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Abandoned_Calls = [Total_Calls] - [Answered_Calls]
?? Answered Rate:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Answered_Rate = DIVIDE([Answered_Calls], [Total_Calls], 0)
?? Abandoned Rate:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Abandoned_Rate = DIVIDE([Abandoned_Calls], [Total_Calls], 0)
?? 3. Calls by Time
?? Create a line chart:

X-axis ? Time_dim[Time]
Y-axis ? Answered_Calls
?? 4. Average Speed of Answer
?? Measure:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Avg_Speed_Answer = AVERAGE(Fact_Calls[Speed of answer in seconds])
?? 5. Agent Performance Quadrant
?? X-axis: Average Handle Time

DAX
Copy
Edit
Avg_Handle_Time = AVERAGE(Fact_Calls[AvgTalkDuration_Seconds])
?? Y-axis: Total Calls Answered

DAX
Copy
Edit
Agent_Calls = COUNTROWS(Fact_Calls)
Create a scatter plot:

X-axis ? Avg_Handle_Time
Y-axis ? Agent_Calls
Legend ? Agent
?? 6. Resolution Rate
?? Measure:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Resolution_Rate = DIVIDE(SUM(Fact_Calls[Resolved_Binary]), [Answered_Calls], 0)
? Step 5: Create Dashboard Elements
?? Tile 1: Overall Performance Overview
? Card visuals for:

Overall Satisfaction
Answered Rate
Abandoned Rate
Avg Speed of Answer
Resolution Rate
?? Tile 2: Calls by Time
? Line chart ? Show call volume over time.

?? Tile 3: Agent Performance
? Scatter plot ? Average Handle Time vs Calls Answered by Agent.

?? Tile 4: Customer Satisfaction Breakdown
? Bar chart ? Satisfaction Rating by Agent.

?? Tile 5: Answered vs Abandoned Calls
? Pie chart ? Show the proportion of answered vs abandoned calls.

? Step 6: Style and Formatting
Use a clean, consistent color theme.
Add dynamic filters for Agent, Date, and Topic.
Title the dashboard "Customer Service Dashboard".
Add Claire’s name at the top for personalization.
? Final Dashboard Structure
? Top Section: KPIs (Satisfaction, Answered Rate, Abandoned Rate, Resolution Rate, Avg Speed)
? Middle Section: Line chart + Scatter plot
? Bottom Section: Bar chart (by agent) + Pie chart
