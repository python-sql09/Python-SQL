# COMPARATIVE OPERATORS
# <     Less than
# <=    Less than or equal to
# >     Greater than
# >=    Greater than or equal to
# ==    Equal to
# !=    Not equal to
# Is    Equal to (equality)
# is not    Not equal to (inequality)

# Using the comparison operators
a = 6
b = 5
print("Is a greater than b?", a > b)
 #greater than
print("Is a less than b?", a < b)
 #less than
print("Is a greater or equal to b?", a >= b)
 #greater or equal
print("Is a less or equal to b?", a <= b)
 #less or equal
print("Is a equal to b (option 1)?", a == b)
 #test for equality
print("Is a equal to b (option 2)?", a is b)
 #test for equality
print("Is a not equal to b (option 1)?", a != b)
 #test for inequality
print("Is a not equal to b (option 2)?", a is not b) #test for inequality
