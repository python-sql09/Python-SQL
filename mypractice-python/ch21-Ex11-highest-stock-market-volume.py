# Exercise 11: Highest Stock Market Volume
# Create a script that uses the reduce() function to compute the trading day where the
# highest volume was recorded in the stocks.csv file. You can use any functions that are
# appropriate for the task, but you must include the reduce() function at least once.
# Display the results in a user-Â­friendly format.
